## Using this code

### R script key

* `functions.R`: Contains functions used in analyses. Make sure the [`librarian` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/librarian/vignettes/intro-to-librarian.html) is installed before running this script.
* `libraries.R`: Contains libraries used in analyses.

### Folder key

* `data`: Contains data collected during 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons.
* `Figures_Tables`: Contains figures and tables summarizing analyses.
* `misc`: Contains miscellaneous files associated with project.
* `renv`: Contains archived versions of packages used in analyses.
* `scripts`: Contains scripts used to clean data, generate haversine distances, and perform analyses.

### Notes

* At the beginning of this project, we referred to the areas in which we sampled milkweed as populations. As the project developed, we decided to stop using the word "population" to refer to these locations and, instead, call them "sampling sites". Please note that the original data, scripts, and output figures/tables may still refer to sampling sites as populations. Outside the context of our question asking how many genetic populations or clusters are present (Q2), the instances of the word "population" should refer to a sampling site.
