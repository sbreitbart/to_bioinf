## Notes for understanding vcfR::maf()'s output

*Each row is a locus.
*nAllele = the number of different alleles sequenced at this
 locus. At most, it's 2n = 261*2=522 because it's a diploid-
 so there's at most 2 alleles per locus for each individual.
 It can drop to numbers like 50 if only, for example,
 50/2n=50/2*261=50/522=~10% of the loci were sequenced.
*Count = the number of times a specific allele was seen at
 this locus.
*Frequency = Count/nAlleles to give the total frequency of
 that specific allele.

There can be bars in the 1 bins on the x axis because of
 missing values. Some loci were only sequenced in a few of
 the individuals (depending on R), so if an allele was seen
 only once but its locus was sequenced in only ~25% of
 individuals, it could still have a frequency >0.05 and
 wind up in the "1 individual" bin.

This holds up because the mmaf = 0.05, R = 1 plot should
 have no missing data and a min minor allele frequency of
 5%, so the first individual should show up at
 0.05*2n=0.05*2*261=26 individuals. It does.
