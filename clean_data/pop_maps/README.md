`pop_map3_1indiv_per_pop`... and `pop_map3_MORE_THAN_1indiv_per_pop`...: Generally, the file structure of these pop maps aligns with the file structure of the Stacks `populations` output which used them as input (see "filtered_vcfs" folder and readme).

`pop_map3_all`...: See first files' description to understand main context for these pop maps. The "all" in these filenames means that these files show the urban/rural categorization for each sampling site based on distance to the city center ("dist") or Urbanization Score ("usc").

`pop_map3_R`... & `pop_map3_U`...: See first files' description to understand main context for these pop maps. The "R" and "U" in these filenames means that these files contain only rural ("R") or urban ("U") sampling sites based on each site's categorization based on distance to the city center ("dist") or Urbanization Score ("usc").

`pop_map3_UR`...: See first files' description to understand main context for these pop maps.
