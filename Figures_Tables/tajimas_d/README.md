### sig_testing

This folder contains output from significance tests to test 1) whether Tajima’s D was significantly different from zero and 2) for a significant difference in mean D between urban and rural groups.

## File description

'tajd_100k': Scatterplots showing mean Tajima’s D across 100 kbp windows for the A) entire population, B) urban habitat when urbanization was classified based on Distance to the City Center, C) urban habitat when urbanization was classified based on Urbanization Score, D) rural habitat when urbanization was classified based on Distance to the City Center, E) rural habitat when urbanization was classified based on Urbanization Score. Mean Tajima’s D across the genome is shown in the center.

'tajd_1mil':  Scatterplots showing mean Tajima’s D across 1,000 kbp windows for the A) entire population, B) urban habitat when urbanization was classified based on Distance to the City Center, C) urban habitat when urbanization was classified based on Urbanization Score, D) rural habitat when urbanization was classified based on Distance to the City Center, E) rural habitat when urbanization was classified based on Urbanization Score. Mean Tajima’s D across the genome is shown in the center.

'taj_d_UvsR_1mil_bp': Table showing results testing for significant differences in mean Tajima’s D between urban and rural habitats, with 1,000 kbp windows.

'taj_d_UvsR_100k_bp': Table showing results testing for significant differences in mean Tajima’s D between urban and rural habitats, with 100 kbp windows.

'taj_d_means': Table showing mean Tajima's D values for both window sizes and urbanization metrics, and t-test results regarding differences from zero.
