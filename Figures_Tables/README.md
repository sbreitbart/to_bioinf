## Folder descriptions

### amova

This folder contains figures and tables from the AMOVA analysis.

### compare_SFS

This folder contains a pdf with many plots showing minor allele counts when different values of --R (the minimum percentage of individuals across populations required to process a locus) and --mmaf (minimum minor allele frequency) are used in the Stacks populations scripts. This helped us identify which parameter values to use.

### conStruct

This folder contains figures and tables from the conStruct analysis.

### correlogram

This folder contains figures and tables from the Mantel correlogram analysis.

### dapc

This folder contains figures from the DAPC analysis.

### fst

### gen_diversity

This folder contains a table showing Watterson's theta and pi values for different groups.

### memgene

This folder contains figures and tables generated with `MEMGENE`. "all_indiv" shows results for the entire dataset (all individuals were included); "rural_subsamp" shows results when only 1 individual for every rural sampling site (based on distance to the city center) was used as the input dataset; "rural_subsamp" shows results when only 1 individual for every rural sampling site (based on urbanization score) was used as the input dataset.

### pca

### permanova_permdisp
