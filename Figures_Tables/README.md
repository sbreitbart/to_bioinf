# Subdirectory: Figures_Tables

## Folder descriptions

### amova

This folder contains figures and tables from the AMOVA analysis.

### compare_SFS

This folder contains a pdf with many plots showing minor allele counts when different values of --R (the minimum percentage of individuals across populations required to process a locus) and --mmaf (minimum minor allele frequency) are used in the Stacks populations scripts. This helped us identify which parameter values to use.

### conStruct

This folder contains figures and tables from the conStruct analysis.

### correlogram

This folder contains figures and tables from the Mantel correlogram analysis.

### dapc

This folder contains figures from the DAPC analysis.

### fis

This folder contains a table with mean FIS values for urban and rural groups.

### fst

This folder contains tables showing hierarchical F-statistics generated with `hierfstat` and manually.

### gen_diversity

This folder contains a table showing Watterson's theta and pi values for different groups.

### memgene

This folder contains figures and tables generated with `MEMGENE`. "all_indiv" shows results for the entire dataset (all individuals were included) and "subsamp_rural" shows results when only 1 individual for every rural sampling site (based on distance to the city center) was used as the input dataset. The other datasets evaluated showed no significant MEMs (i.e., no spatial genetic structure was detected).

### pca

This folder contains figures and tables of the PCA results.

### permanova_permdisp

This folder contains figures and tables of the permanova and permdisp analyses.

### radish

This folder contains figures and tables of `radish` analyses.

### regressions

This folder contains figures and tables showing regressions and ANOVA showing how different population genetic parameters vary with urbanization.

### sample_site_map

This folder contains maps of the sampling sites.

### sample_site_sizes

This folder contains figures showing how many individuals were sampled at each sampling site.

### Stairway_plot

This folder contains demographic modelling plots for various mutation rates, as well as historical human population trends for Toronto, Ontario, and Canada, to contextualize the former plots.

### tajimas_d

This folder contains figures and tables related to Tajima's D.

### urb_metrics

This folder contains figures and tables showing the association between distance to the city center and Urbanization Score.
